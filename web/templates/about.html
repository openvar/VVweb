        <dd>
          VariantValidator is an Open Source project exclusively funded by grant income and generous contributions from
          the University of Manchester (UK) and the University of Leicester (UK).  In order to apply for external funding
          and to retain funding from our host institutions we must demonstrate the wider impact of our software throughout
          the global genomics community. By providing us with some basic information, you are helping us to demonstrate
          the need for the software and will help us to build a convincing case which will enable the continued
          maintenance and future development of this community driven resource.

          We will not share any personal data with external organisations. We may use data that you have submitted to

          or email addresses.

        <dt>Why do I need to provide an email address</dt>
        <dd><a name="terms"></a>
          We require an email address to validate your account, i.e. to ensure that the requested account has
          originated from a genuine email address. Our batch services require an email address so that data can be
          returned to you, therefore by creating and verifying your account, we can ensure that your data will only ever
          be returned to you. We will only contact you directly if we receive a direct query from you, or via automated
          responses generated by our batch tools. For any further information or to ask for additional information,
          please contact us on <a href="mailto:admin@variantvalidator.org">admin@variantvalidator.org</a> or via our

        VariantValidator. All information returned by VariantValidator, including variant classifications, is
        subject to change and there is no warranty, express or implied, as to its accuracy, completeness, or
        fitness for a particular purpose. Use of VariantValidator and information is subject to User
        responsibility and discretion. Clinical decisions regarding individual patient care should be carried
        out in conjunction with a healthcare professional with expertise in the relevant genes and diseases.

          The University of Leicester shall have the right, in its reasonable
          and good faith discretion, to remove or modify materials accessed by VariantValidator or outputs
          provided by VariantValidator because such materials contain errors or could be subject to an
          infringement or other adverse claim by a third party.
        </dd>
        <dt>Remedial Action.</dt>
        <dd>
          Without limiting the above, University may suspend delivery of the Service if it reasonably

          particular purpose or ability to achieve a particular result. Limitation of Liability. University’s
          total liability for any claims, losses, damages or expenses whatsoever and howsoever caused

          paid to University for the products or services that are the subject of the User’s claim.
